# minishell

collaboration with rrupp (BasilikDark)

"Minishell" is a project centered around creating a simple shell, akin to a miniature version of bash. 
Students will delve into processes and file descriptors, gaining insight into the fundamentals of shell operation. 
The project offers a journey through the history of computing, where shells evolved as a means of human-computer interaction, rendering the archaic method of using aligned 1/0 switches obsolete. 
With Minishell, students can explore the challenges of computing before the advent of modern operating systems like Windows. 
The project follows common instructions, requiring adherence to the Norm, proper memory management, and the inclusion of a Makefile.
